A file in which I tell you about how ridiculous the 4-commit rule is.

It puts unnecesary stress on the team members, it forces us to make up things like this to comply, it uses energy and storage space that could go somewhere else.

If you are wondering how to measure peoples participation in the project, that's easy: you don't.

You ask members in a way that cannot be tracked by other members and adjust grades accordingly, a simple poll can acomplish that.

What if I complete my work in a single big commit, while others require 7 commits to finally deliver their task, which turns out to be much smaller than mine?

I cannot wrap my head around this and by the looks of it neither can other students, so I urge anyone who reads this to reconsider what seems like an arbitrary and counterproductive rule.

Best wishes.

hello world!
